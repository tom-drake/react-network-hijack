# React Network Hijack

The aim for this library is to provide an easy way to mock network requests in a browser while using React components. This was originally developed with the intent of being used as part of your stories in [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) but there is no reason it shouldn't work with a framework which runs in the browser.
